# Removing All Drivers from a .WIM File

This guide explains how to remove all drivers from a `.wim` file using `DISM` (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tool.

## Prerequisites

1. A Windows machine with administrative privileges.
2. The `.wim` file you want to modify.
3. DISM tool (pre-installed on most Windows systems).

## Steps to Remove Drivers

1. **Mount the .WIM File**  
    Mount the `.wim` file to a directory for modification:
    ```bash
    dism /Mount-Wim /WimFile:"C:\path\to\your\file.wim" /Index:1 /MountDir:"C:\Mount"
    ```

2. **List Installed Drivers**  
    View all drivers in the mounted `.wim` file:
    ```bash
    dism /Image:"C:\Mount" /Get-Drivers
    ```

3. **Remove Drivers**  
    Remove all third-party drivers from the image:
    ```bash
    dism /Image:"C:\Mount" /Remove-Driver /Driver:oem*.inf
    ```

4. **Commit Changes**  
    Save the changes and unmount the `.wim` file:
    ```bash
    dism /Unmount-Wim /MountDir:"C:\Mount" /Commit
    ```

5. **Verify Changes**  
    Optionally, remount the `.wim` file and list drivers again to confirm removal.

## Notes

- Always back up your `.wim` file before making changes.
- Removing critical drivers may cause issues with deployment.
