### Introduction

#### Check IOMMU Support

Open a terminal.
Run the following command to check for IOMMU support in your system:
```sh
dmesg | grep -e IOMMU
```
This command will display information about IOMMU support. If you see relevant information, it means IOMMU is supported on your hardware.

#### Edit GRUB Configuration

To enable IOMMU in the GRUB bootloader, you need to edit the /etc/default/grub file. You can use a text editor like nano or vi to do this. For example:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```
Find the line that starts with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT. It may look something like this:

```sh
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
```
Modify the line to include IOMMU settings. Add intel_iommu=on iommu=pt to the existing settings within the double quotes. It should look like this:

```sh
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt"
```
Save the file and exit the text editor.

#### Update GRUB

After modifying the GRUB configuration, you need to update GRUB to apply the changes. Run the following command:
```sh
sudo update-grub
```
This command regenerates the GRUB configuration with the updated settings.

#### Verify IOMMU Settings

To verify that the IOMMU settings have been correctly applied, you can once again run the following command:
```sh
dmesg | grep -e IOMMU
```
This will display any IOMMU-related information in your system logs. If the settings were applied correctly, you should see relevant output indicating that IOMMU is enabled.
