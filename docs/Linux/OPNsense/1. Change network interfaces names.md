### Introduction

This guide explains how to change the names of network interfaces on OPNsense.

### Steps

1. Navigate to the directory `/usr/local/etc/rc.syshook.d/early`.

2. Copy any file in this directory and clear its contents.

3. Add the following script to the file:

    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh

    ifconfig em0 name net0
    ifconfig em1 name net1
    ifconfig em2 name net2
    ```

        This script is an example. You need to replace `em0`, `em1`, and `em2` with the actual names of your network interfaces and `net0`, `net1`, and `net2` with the desired new names.

This script renames the network interfaces `em0`, `em1`, and `em2` to `net0`, `net1`, and `net2` respectively.
